# Toxic-Comment-Classifier-using-NLP-and-Naive-Bayes

"Develop a dependable and effective machine learning model capable of classifying comments and tweets into toxic and non-toxic categories, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques" is the project's problem statement. This entails overcoming a number of obstacles, including managing the complex and varied nature of language, resolving imbalances in datasets, and guaranteeing the model's scalability and suitability for use across a range of online platforms.

#Technologies Used:
To achieve the objectives of this project, a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms are employed. The key technologies and tools used include:

1.	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient handling of large datasets and numerical computations.
2.	Matplotlib: For visualizing data distributions and model performance metrics.
3.	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For preprocessing text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words, which are crucial steps in preparing textual data for machine learning models.
4.	Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is well-suited for text classification tasks.
5.	TF-IDF Vectorization: A technique used to convert textual data into numerical features, reflecting the importance of words in documents relative to the entire dataset.
6.	Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model and the TF-IDF vectorizer, ensuring the reproducibility and usability of the model in real-world applications.
7.	Tkinter: For creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to input comments or tweets and receive real-time classification results.
This combination of technologies provides a comprehensive framework for building and deploying a toxic comment classifier, leveraging the strengths of both traditional NLP methods and modern machine learning techniques. The implementation details and evaluation results are discussed in the subsequent sections of this paper, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed solution in addressing the issue of online toxicity.
